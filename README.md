A comprehensive demonstration of different state management approaches in Angular applications. This project showcases implementations using NgRx, NGXS, and TanStack Query, helping developers understand and compare different state management solutions.

## ‚ú® State Management Solutions

### üîÑ Featured Libraries

- **[NgRx](https://ngrx.io/):** A reactive state management library for Angular applications, built on top of RxJS.
- **[NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/):** A state management pattern + library for Angular applications.
